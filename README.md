# Bean There Coffee Shop Website

## 📌 Project Overview
This project details the design and development of the official website for **Bean There Coffee Shop**, a local café in Capiz known for its perfectly brewed coffee and delicious snacks. The website is developed as a student project to showcase a visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive platform that highlights the shop’s unique offerings and vintage-inspired ambiance.

The website provides essential features such as an online ordering system, a loyalty rewards program, product categorization, and an About Us page that tells the café’s story. The system is designed with scalability in mind, ensuring the client can later implement additional features if desired.
